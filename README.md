# Fluorite: Apache Calcite trace analyzer

## [Try it here](https://anha1.github.io/fluorite/)

Fluorite is an interactive visual [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/) traces analyzer.
It gives an ability to view a visual representation of Calcite traces: Rels, Subsets, Sets,
so it is possible to explore not only the best plan but also dead-end options generated by
Rules during planning.

In order to obtain a trace to be used as an input, run Calcite planning with TRACE logging level enabled for "org.apache.calcite.plan.RelOptPlanner".

It is named Fluorite because [Fluorite scratches Calcite's surfarce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness).

Tested with Calcite versions: 1.18, 1.19.
